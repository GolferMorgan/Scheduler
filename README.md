## The Assignment
In this assignment we were tasked with making to time blocks show up different colors based on whether they were in the past, present or future. We also had to store everything that was typed in the description box in local storage using the .setItem method. Then we had to be able to retrieve everything from local storage using the .getItem method. I also set an alert telling you the appointment had been saved when you click on the saveBtn icon. I relied a lot on the help of classmates and TA's to help me work through some of the struggles and make my code more efficient.
